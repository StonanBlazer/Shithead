# Shithead
card game

the game is shithead, the aim to not be the shithead (last one out).

you play the game by working up the from 2 -> A.

so at the start of the game the deck is shuffled and cards dealt going left of the dealer.

place 3 cards FACE DOWN infront of each player they will be the final 3 cards and they cant be seen untill you put them on the pile at the end.

then give out an additional 6 cards to each player and the rest of the cards are put to the side.

each player then selects 3 of the 6 cards in their hand and places them ontop of the 3 face down cards, when the pick up pile runs out you can use these 3 cards followed by the 3 face down. we usually put any magic cards we have here.

you should always have 3 cards in your hand unless the pic up pile has gone.

to start the game if anyone has a 4 in their hand they begin, if no one has a 4 then left of the dealer begins and can play any card.

going round clockwise to begin you each place a card that has to be higher in value to the card placed before. if you do not have a card higher then the one placed then you can use a magic card 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 (if theres more than 2 players) 10 or joker. if you still cant play a card you have to pick up the pile that has just been played.

pick up card(s) if you have less than 3 in your hand and cards still on the pick up pile.

you can play multiples of cards at the same time, if you play 4 or complete 4 in a row on the playing pile, the pile is burnt to the discard pile and you can play again.

magic card rules:
2 - resets the pile so next card can be anything.
3 - mirrors the card underneath.
7 - the next card played HAS to be below 7, magic cards 8, 9 and 10 wont work.
8 - skips the next players turn.
9 - switches the way of play (used only with 3 or more player).
10 - burns the played pile and put it in the discard pile.
joker - the joker can be any card you choose, normal or magic.
